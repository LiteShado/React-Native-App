/**
 * Component Protocols
 * 
 * Components need to be divided into their smallest forms. Each component should accomplish one function or task. 
 * 
 * Components can be nested to provide complex functionality.
 * 
 * Styled Components in the styles.js file will be used for styling JSX components like cards and logos etc.
